I'm a Biosystems engineering student that enjoys rock climbing. 
Between Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop, all seem valuable and seem to require each other in order to function to their best potential. 
Overall, this lab taught me why interactions between GitHub and GitHub Desktop are necessary and useful for updating code.
